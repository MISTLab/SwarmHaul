# üêú SwarmHaul: Decentralized Caging and Transport by Robot Swarms

**SwarmHaul** is a biologically inspired multi-robot system for collective object transport, motivated by the efficiency of ant colonies. Ants are known to move objects significantly larger than themselves with remarkable coordination ‚Äî often outperforming humans. In contrast, many current multi-robot systems depend on extensive prior information such as object shape, precise initial formations, or centralized planning, limiting their real-world applicability.

## üîç What SwarmHaul Does

This repository presents decentralized control rules for swarm-based object manipulation that require minimal assumptions:

+ Only **one robot** (a "seed") needs to know the direction in which the object is located.
+ The seed robot **attaches to the object** and recruits only two other robots through **virtual stigmergy**, starting two growing branches around the object.
+ This process continue iteratively, where each robot in a branch recruits one another robot sequentially, eventually this process leads to **caging the object completely**.
+ Once caged, robots cooperatively **translate and rotate** the object by maintaining a shared estimate of the object‚Äôs centroid ‚Äî purely via local interactions (no external measurements or global coordinates required).

## üß† Key Features
+ ‚úÖ Theoretical guarantees for caging any arbitrary convex objects
+ ü§ñ Decentralized coordination with no global position tracking
+ üîÑ Simulations with up to 100 robots
+ üß™ Real-world experiments with 6 differential-drive robots
+ üß© Extensible to heterogeneous swarms with onboard path planning (e.g., drones, AMRs)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
For installation, you can either install everything from source or use the Docker installation

### Install the Argos3 simulator and Buzz
Follow the instructions in this page to install/build the programming language Buzz and Argos3 [github.com/buzz-lang/Buzz/blob/master/doc/argos-integration.md](https://github.com/buzz-lang/Buzz/blob/master/doc/argos-integration.md)

### Install the Khepera Plugin 
Install the khepera robot plugin for Argos3. These are the robots that will perform the collective transport
https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3-kheperaiv

### Install SwarmHaul repository

The order is important build `Hooks_src` before `Loop_fun_src`. 

```
git clone http://git.mistlab.ca/vvaradharajan/collaborative_transport.git

cd collaborative_transport/src/Hooks_src/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make 

cd collaborative_transport/src/Loop_fun_src/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make 
```

### Docker

You can build the docker in the docker `docker` folder. There is a `build.sh` that let's you do that. Finally you can run an interactive shell with sharing the display between the host computer for the gui with the `run.sh`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running experiments

1. Compile the buzz script:

```
cd scripts
bzzc -I includes/ Simulation.bzz
cd ..
```
2. run the associated argos file 
```
argos3 -c experiment.argos

# How to control the arguments in the experiment
<loop_functions library="src/Loop_fun_src/build/libplanning_exp.so" 
 label="Planning"
 map_file_name="src/maps/Comparisions/empty.map" 
 map_option="0"
 robots="ROBOTS" # No of robots check below
 out_file="OUTFILE" # suffix to add to out files containg data for plotting
 path="PATH" # can be straight, zigzac or straight_rot
 inter_cage_dist="INTERCAGEDIST" # distance between caging
 random_seed_set="RANDOMSEED" # random seed for the experiment
 object_type="OBJECTTYPE"/> # type of object 

Object type enum 
0 - square object of size (2,2) for 25 robots
1 - square object of size (3.6,6) for 50 robots 
2 - square object of size (7.2,18) for 100 robots
3 - cloud shape for caging tests
4 - box_rotation shape for caging tests
5 - clover shape for caging tests - needs 50 robots
```
